function Xi = Xi_diff_BM(Xi_T,Xi_L,diff,kmax,N)
% Function to build Xi operator with diffusion effects for BM (6 states per
% k-value). 
% This function efficiently uses spdiags to build the large band diagonal
% matrix that results from applying Xi_L and Xi_T to each order of states.
% Diffusion changes the matrices applied to each order, which this function
% takes care of.
